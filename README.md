_Known as the most famous of all kingdoms, the Mushroom Kingdom was primarily home to the Mushroom People, also known as Toads, as well as other species. The kingdom's government used to be an established monarchy ruled by Princess Peach._

## Welcome to the Mushroom Kingdom!

This mod was made with the intent of porting the Mushroom Kingdom map from **Super Mario Galaxy**, while also adding some overall changes to the moon/game as a whole. It's my first public mod, so I hope that you all enjoy it! If it's received well, I'll consider making more.

If you have any requests or feedback to give, I'm in the [Unofficial Lethal Company Comunity](https://discord.gg/nYcQFEpXfU) Discord server! (or just message me on Discord @Gabrimer)

> ***A LITTLE HEADS UP FOR CONTENT CREATORS: THIS MOD CONTAINS SOUNDTRACK FROM "SUPER MARIO GALAXY"***
